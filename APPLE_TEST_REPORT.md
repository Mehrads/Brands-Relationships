## 🧠 Nuanced Understanding Demonstrated

### 1. Context-Dependent Relationships ✅

**LG Display**: Classified as SUPPLIER with context "component_supply"

- Microsoft is a competitor despite using same AI provider (OpenAI)
- Nuance: Different strategic approaches = competition
```

- Confidence: 0.60 (LOW)
- FLAGGED for review ⚠️

✅ SMART: Recognized the denial and reduced confidence appropriately
```

### 4. Perfect Disambiguation ✅

#### Apple Bank

```

- **Decision**: ✅ Correctly flagged - relationship uncertain

#### 2. Apple-Reddit Relationship
- **Confidence**: 0.60 (below 0.70 threshold)
- **Reason**: Platform mention, not business relationship
