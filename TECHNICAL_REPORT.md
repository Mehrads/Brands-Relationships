# Technical Report: Multi-Agent GraphRAG System for Automated Brand Analysis

## Executive Summary

We developed a production-ready multi-agent system that automates brand relationship analysis using GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Neo4j. The system addresses the critical challenge of extracting nuanced, context-dependent relationships between brands from unstructured text, replacing manual analysis with intelligent automation while maintaining high accuracy and cost efficiency.

## Problem Statement

Traditional brand analysis faces three fundamental limitations:

1. **Context Dependency**: The same companies can have different relationships in different contexts (e.g., Apple-Samsung as competitors in smartphones vs. partners in supply chain). Since these complex, context-dependent relationships can be more effectively represented and queried using graph databases, we decided to use GraphRAG for our solution.
2. **Scale Limitations**: Manual analysis doesn't scale for enterprise content volumes
3. **Semantic Complexity**: Simple regex patterns fail to capture nuanced business relationships

Our solution transforms unstructured text into a structured knowledge graph that captures these complexities while providing real-time analysis capabilities.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

**Multi-Agent Pipeline**:
- **Brand Extractor**: LLM-powered entity recognition with normalization
- **Citation Extractor**: Hybrid URL extraction + LLM association
- **Category Agent**: Industry classification with confidence scoring
- **Relationship Agent**: Context-aware relationship classification
- **Web Search Agent**: Tavily API integration for missing relationship data

**GraphRAG Integration**:
- **Neo4j Aura**: Cloud-hosted graph database for relationship storage
- **Context-Aware Storage**: Relationships stored with subcategory and sentiment metadata
- **Intelligent Caching**: Reduces API costs through relationship reuse

### System Workflow

**Workflow Explanation**:

The system follows a structured multi-agent pipeline that transforms unstructured text into a comprehensive knowledge graph:

1. **Input Processing**: Raw text undergoes preprocessing and cleaning before entering the pipeline

2. **Unified Extraction Agent (Circle - Blue)**: Single agent that performs three parallel extraction tasks:
   - **Brand Extraction**: Identifies and extracts brand mentions with context
   - **Category Classification**: Determines industry categories and subcategories  
   - **Citation Extraction**: Extracts sources, URLs, and associated text passages

3. **Data Processing Tools (Squares - Orange)**: Sequential processing steps:
   - **Brand Normalization**: Standardizes brand names (e.g., "Meta Platforms, Inc." → "Meta")
   - **Deduplication Logic**: Merges duplicate brand entries
   - **URL Extraction**: Regex-based identification of web links
   - **LLM Citation Parsing**: Associates URLs with relevant text passages

4. **Relationship Agent (Circle - Blue)**: Core classification engine that receives all extracted data and performs:
   - **Context-Aware Classification**: Determines relationship types based on specific contexts
   - **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns 0-1 confidence scores to each relationship
   - **Relationship Storage**: Persists new relationships to the knowledge graph

5. **Specialized Search Tools (Diamonds - Pink)**: Positioned beside Relationship Agent:
   - **Graph Search Tool**: Queries Neo4j database for existing relationships (cache hits)
   - **Web Search Tool**: Uses Tavily API to find missing relationship data (cache misses)
   - Both tools connect bidirectionally with Relationship Agent using dotted lines

6. **Final LLM Aggregator (Circle - Blue)**: Processes all information and generates structured JSON output

7. **Output Generation**: Produces machine-readable JSON and interactive Neo4j dashboard visualizations

**Key Architectural Features**:
- **Parallel Processing**: Extraction tasks run simultaneously for efficiency
- **GraphRAG Caching**: Reduces API costs by reusing existing relationships
- **Context Switching**: Same brands can have different relationships in different contexts
- **Modular Design**: Each component can be independently improved or replaced


### Why Neo4j for GraphRAG

We chose Neo4j over alternatives (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, vector databases) for several strategic reasons:

**1. Native Graph Operations**
- Cypher query language optimized for relationship traversal
- Built-in algorithms for graph analytics (centrality, clustering)
- Efficient storage of complex relationship hierarchies

**2. Production Scalability**
- Neo4j Aura provides managed cloud infrastructure
- Automatic scaling and backup capabilities
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance

**3. Rich Visualization**
- Neo4j Bloom dashboard for interactive graph exploration
- Real-time relationship analytics and KPIs
- Customizable graph layouts and filtering

## Neo4j Dashboard Analysis

The dashboard visualizations demonstrate our system's effectiveness. *Note: Dashboard screenshots from Neo4j Bloom showing real-time analytics of our brand relationship graph.*

### 1. Relationship Sentiment Distribution

- **Alias Resolution**: Multiple mentions of same entity consolidated
- **Domain Extraction**: URL-to-brand mapping for citation association

### Context-Aware Relationship Storage
```cypher
// Relationships stored with context metadata
(source:Brand)-[r:RELATES_TO {
  category: "technology/consumer_electronics",
  relationship_context: "supply_chain",
  sentiment: "positive",
  confidence: 0.95
}]->(target:Brand)
```

### Confidence Scoring System
- **0.9-1.0**: High confidence (direct evidence)
